<!-- ABOUT -->
## Topic
For our Midterm Project we did an R package review on `generativeart` by Katharina Brunner. 

There are 3 sections: Package Detail, Examples of Generation, and Summary. Take a look at [Izzy Shehan's RPubs page](https://rpubs.com/izzy-shehan/750493).

## Author
The R package `generativeart` was created by Katharina Brunner, a German data analyst and software developer, to introduce human-independent randomness to creative processes.

## Overview

Generative art is the intercalation of controlled randomness into artistic systems; the package `generativeart` in R simplifies autonomous system creation by packaging data initialization and visualization processes into basic hyperparameters and generative functions.

`generativeart` allows for easy process iteration and image replication with structured output directories and log CSVs (preserving the file name, seed, and formula of all generated images in an easily accessible and readable format).



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

`generativeart` can be installed from github with devtool.

```
devtools::install_github("cutterkom/generativeart")
```

See an example tutorial and the rest of documentation on the [RPubs page](https://rpubs.com/izzy-shehan/750493).
